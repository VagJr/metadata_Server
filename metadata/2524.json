Deal one card face down to each player, setting the rest aside. Each player secretly looks at their card, then searches its card name using an internet search engine. Navigate to the first three image results that are not of a Magic card or Magic art, then choose one of those images. If you're unsure if something depicts Magic art, use your best judgment.",
