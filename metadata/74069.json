This is the monster you will face. Discard all ad, token, and art cards. Shuffle the remaining cards into a stack and place it face down to create your library.\nLET'S PLAY:\nPlay a game of Magic against the monster with the following rule modifications:\n• You start with zero cards in hand and 20 life.\n• At the beginning of your upkeep, create a Treasure token. (It's an artifact with \"{T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Add one mana of any color.\")\nThe monster doesn't have a life total, mana, or library, and it can only be defeated by removing it from the battlefield twice: once on its front side and once on its transformed side.",
