Each player opens a booster and sets aside any cards without Magic card backs.\nLET'S PLAY:\nPlayers look at their hands, pick three cards, and then place their picked cards in a face down row in front of their opponent's row. Players reveal the pairs of cards from Day player's left to right simultaneously. Winning cards are decided as follows:\n• Red beats green\n• Green beats blue\n• Blue beats red\n• White is always a winning card for the Day player, but it's always a losing card for the Night player\n• Black is always a winning card for the Night player, but it's always a losing card for the Day player.",
