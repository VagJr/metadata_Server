Then sort the cards into separate piles for double-faced cards (DFCs), single-sided creature and planeswalker cards, land cards, and all other noncreature cards. Shuffle the piles and place each of them face down.\nLET'S PLAY:\nGo through the beats of the story below in order, revealing a card from the top of the specified pile or taking the specified action. Tell a story as you go. After a player tells a bit of the story for a beat, it's the next player's turn for the next story beat. If there are no cards of the requested type, players can make something up.\n**Introduction**\n• Setting: a land\n• The characters: three creatures/planeswalkers\n• Why the characters are at the location: a noncreature card",
