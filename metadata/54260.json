Work together to design and illustrate a unique _Magic_ card.\nGET READY:\nOpen a booster, remove all non-_Magic_ cards and shuffle the rest. Have one player be an artist and another be a writer, then the remaining players will be designers.\nLET'S PLAY:\nThe designers take turns filling out the different parts of a card with pen and paper. To determine these, they draw a random card from the pack, pick one of the categories, and copy it from the card (if it's missing the category you want, draw another). The designers continue until these are all filled in:",
