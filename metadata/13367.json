(Foil uncommons, rares, and mythics can be used as either a map or a guide!)\nThe basic land is the location of the ruins. When a player reveals the land, if they have no guides, they are killed by the Roil and eliminated from the game. If that player has one guide, they survive. In either case, the ruins (and the guide) are put back onto the table face down, the cards are randomized, and play continues.\nTO WIN:\nThe first player to collect two guides and find the ruins—or the last player standing—wins!",
