Separate into a pile of creatures and a pile of noncreatures.\nLET'S PLAY:\n• Each round, turn the two piles face down and shuffle them. Then determine which player was assassinated. That player is the clue-giving ghost for the round. The ghost is not allowed to communicate with the other players, except as directed.\n• The ghost looks at the top card of the creature pile. That is the assassin who killed them. Shuffle the cards in the creature pile and reveal them. Then reveal three random cards from the noncreature pile. The ghost chooses one of the noncreatures as a clue. (Try picking a card with similar art or theme to the assassin!)",
