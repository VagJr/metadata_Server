Race your fellow artificers to assemble all three iconic locations.\nGET READY:\nOpen a booster for each player and remove any cards without _Magic_ card backs. Shuffle the remaining cards into a deck and deal five cards to each player. Randomly determine who goes first.\nLET'S PLAY:\nOn each player's turn, they draw a card, then discard a card face up. Players may draw either the top card of the deck or the top card of the discard pile. If there are no cards left in the deck when a player tries to draw, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.",
