Shuffle the remaining cards into a face down deck. Randomly determine who goes first—that player is the *Interpreter*.\nLET'S PLAY:\nThe interpreter draws a *mystery card* from the top of the deck, rolls a d20, and then gives a clue determined by the result of their roll (see opposite side of card). The Interpreter then draws five more cards from the deck, shuffles them together with the mystery card, and then reveals them. The other players collectively guess which of the six cards is the mystery card. If they guess correctly, all players score 1 point as a team. After guessing, the round ends and the Interpreter puts the used cards in a discard pile. If the deck runs out of cards, shuffle the discard pile to create a new deck.\nThe Interpreter role then passes to the next player. The game ends after six rounds.",
