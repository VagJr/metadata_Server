Scramble to get the best stuff!\nGET READY:\nOpen both packs and remove all cards without _Magic_ card backs. *Select one art card* and shuffle it in with the rest of the cards, which represent the food. Deal the cards face up in a 5x5 grid. Randomly determine who goes first.\nLET'S PLAY:\nOn your turn, choose a *color* (including colorless). Then move the art card either vertically or horizontally on the grid, skipping empty spaces and collecting each card in your path that matches your chosen color. (Reminder: Lands are colorless.) The art card can move in only one direction per turn, and",
