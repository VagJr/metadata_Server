You may also know this game as Pack Wars!\nGET READY:\nEach player opens a pack and sets aside any cards without Magic card backs, trying not to look at the rest of the cards. Then they add three of each basic land (Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest) to their pack and shuffle. This becomes the player's deck.\nLET'S PLAY:\nRandomly determine who goes first, then play a game of Magic! There are many variants of Mini-Master. The following are modified rules you can add to your game:",
